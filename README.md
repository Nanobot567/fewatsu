## what exactly is fewatsu, anyway?

`Fewatsu` is, at its core, a document parser and viewer inspired by the Nintendo 3DS' [E-manual feature](https://github.com/Nanobot567/fewatsu/tree/main/assets/3ds).

It's meant to be extremely simple to set up and use, so pretty much anyone can implement it into their Playdate game!
